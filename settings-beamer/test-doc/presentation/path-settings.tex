%==== SETTINGS PATH
% Here we follow a similar strategy as for graphics path
\def \generalSettingsPath{../../../latex-general-settings/}
\def \beamerSettingsPath{../../settings/}

%==== PROJECT DETAILS
% Here we follow a similar strategy as for graphics path
\def \projectPath{../project-details/}



%==== BIB
% Here we follow a similar strategy as for graphics path
\def \bibPath{../bib/}


%==== GLOSSARY
% Here we follow a similar strategy as for graphics path
\def \glossaryPath{../glossary/}


%==== FIGURES

% This defines a variable for the path to the directory where figures are located
\def \logoPath{../logos/}

% This defines a variable for the path to the directory where figures are located
\def \figPath{../figs/}

% \graphicspath defines where the latex graphics package looks for files called by \includegraphics{...}
\graphicspath{{\figPath}{\logoPath}}
%or for multiple folders: \def\input@path{{/path/to/folder}{/path/to/other/folder}}
% With these settings you can load a graphic form ../figs/fig.png using only \includegraphics{fig.png} 
% BEWARE that not all packages are aware of the graphicspath variable
% (e.g. epstopdf is not)!
% In those cases call by \includegraphics{\figPath fig.eps}


%==== INPUT PATH
% Here we follow a similar strategy as for graphics path
\def \tabPath{../tables/}

% Here we follow a similar strategy as for graphics path
\def \tikzPath{\figPath}

% This defines where latex looks for files called by \input{...}
