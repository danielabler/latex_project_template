%==== FIGURES

% This defines a variable for the path to the directory where figures are located
\def \logoPath{\resourcesPath/logos/}

% This defines a variable for the path to the directory where figures are located
\def \figPath{\resourcesPath/figs/}

% \graphicspath defines where the latex graphics package looks for files called by \includegraphics{...}
\graphicspath{{\figPath}{\logoPath}}
%or for multiple folders: \def\input@path{{/path/to/folder}{/path/to/other/folder}}
% With these settings you can load a graphic form ../figs/fig.png using only \includegraphics{fig.png} 
% BEWARE that not all packages are aware of the graphicspath variable
% (e.g. epstopdf is not)!
% In those cases call by \includegraphics{\figPath fig.eps}
